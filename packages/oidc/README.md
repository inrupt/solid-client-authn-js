# oidc-client-ext

This library is built on top of [`oidc-client-js`](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js) (forked in [`@inrupt/oidc-clienr`](https://github.com/inrupt/oidc-client-js)), and adds the following features to it:

- Dynamic client registration
  [Dynamic Client Registration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) is part of the [OpenID](https://openid.net) specification and it allows OAuth client applications to dynamically register with an OAuth server.
  To learn more about how this works, you can have a look at [this page](https://curity.io/resources/architect/openid-connect/openid-connect-understanding-dcr/)

- DPoP tokens for authentication
  [DPoP](https://oauth.net/2/dpop/), or Demonstration of Proof of Possession, is part of the [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) spec and is an extension that describes a technique to cryptographically bind access tokens to a particular client when they are issued. This is one of many attempts at improving the security of Bearer Tokens by requiring the application using the token to authenticate itself.

This [proposed standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fett-oauth-dpop-04) is still in draft status.

# Other Inrupt Solid JavaScript Libraries

[`@inrupt/oidc-client-ext`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inrupt/oidc-client-ext) is part of a family open source JavaScript libraries designed to support developers building Solid applications.

## Solid JavaScript Authentication - solid-client-authn

`solid-client-authn` is a set of libraries designed to authenticate with Solid identity servers.
The libraries share a common API and include different modules for different deployment environments:

- `solid-client-authn-browser` can be used to help build web apps in the browser.
- `solid-client-authn-node` is **planned** to help build server-side and console-based apps.

@inrupt/solid-client-authn libraries are part of a family open source JavaScript libraries designed to support developers building Solid applications.

## Inrupt Solid JavaScript Client Libraries

### Data access and permissions management - solid-client

[`@inrupt/solid-client`](https://docs.inrupt.com/client-libraries/solid-client-js/) allows developers to access data and manage permissions on data stored in Solid Pods.

### Authentication - solid-client-authn

[`@inrupt/solid-client-authn`](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn) allows developers to authenticate against a Solid server. This is necessary when the resources on your Pod are not public.

### Vocabularies and interoperability - solid-common-vocab-rdf

[`@inrupt/solid-common-vocab-rdf`](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-common-vocab-rdf) allows developers to build interoperable apps by reusing well-known vocabularies. These libraries provide vocabularies available as constants that you just have to import.
