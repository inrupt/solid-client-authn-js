### Data access and permissions management - solid-client

[@inrupt/solid-client](https://docs.inrupt.com/client-libraries/solid-client-js/) allows developers to access data and manage permissions on data stored in Solid Pods.

### Authentication - solid-client-authn

[@inrupt/solid-client-authn](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn) allows developers to authenticate against a Solid server. This is necessary when the resources on your Pod are not public.

### Vocabularies and interoperability - solid-common-vocab-rdf

[@inrupt/solid-common-vocab-rdf](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-common-vocab-rdf) allows developers to build interoperable apps by reusing well-known vocabularies. These libraries provide vocabulary terms as constants that you just have to import.
