# `solid-client-authn-browser` sample app

This application provides a snippet of code showcasing usage of the
`solid-client-authn-browser` library in a `script` tag, without using a bundler.

## Install and run

- Run `npm ci` and `npm run build` in the **root** directory, to build `solid-client-authn-browser`.
- Run `node server.mjs` to start the app. It will start a small web server bound to
  `http://localhost:3001`, that resolves the browser bundle for `solid-client-authn-browser`.
