`solid-client-authn` is a suite of libraries to manage the authentication required to access protected resources on Solid servers.
The libraries share a common API and include different modules for different deployment environments:

- `solid-client-authn-browser` can be used to build web apps in the browser.
- `solid-client-authn-node` can be used to build server-side and console-based apps.

@inrupt/solid-client-authn libraries are part of a suite open source JavaScript libraries designed to support developers building Solid applications.

# Inrupt Solid JavaScript Client Libraries

## Data access and permissions management - solid-client

[@inrupt/solid-client](https://docs.inrupt.com/client-libraries/solid-client-js/) allows developers to access data and manage permissions on data stored in Solid Pods.

## Authentication - solid-client-authn

[@inrupt/solid-client-authn](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn) allows developers to authenticate against a Solid server. This is necessary when the resources on your Pod are not public.

## Vocabularies and interoperability - solid-common-vocab-rdf

[@inrupt/solid-common-vocab-rdf](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-common-vocab-rdf) allows developers to build interoperable apps by reusing well-known vocabularies. These libraries provide vocabulary terms as constants that you just have to import.

## How to run test apps?

### Browser

```shell
git clone https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn-js
cd solid-client-authn-js
npm ci
cd packages/browser/examples/single/bundle/
npm ci
npm run start
```
Go to http://localhost:3001/.

### NodeJS

#### Running a server-side app

```shell
git clone https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn-js
cd solid-client-authn-js
npm ci
cd packages/node/example/demoClientApp/
npm ci
npm run start
```
Go to http://localhost:3001/.

#### Running an authenticated script

See [the dedicated documentation](/packages/node/examples/bootstrappedApp/README.md).

## Using with jest

Due to [a behavior from jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/2524), `@inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser` needs some adjustments if you want to run it with `jest`. There are multiple options, listed in [a dedicated issue](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn-js/issues/1676). Thanks to [Angelo V.](https://github.com/angelo-v) for proposing a mitigation.
